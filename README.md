# RUAccent Node for ComfyUI

‚ú® A custom node for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) that adds **automatic stress marking (accenting)** to Russian text using the [RUAccent](https://github.com/Den4ikAI/ruaccent) library.

## What It Does

This node uses advanced NLP models to place stress accents (`+`) in Russian words, which is useful for:

* Text-to-speech systems
* Audiobook preparation
* Linguistic analysis
* Rhythmic or poetic formatting

## Features

* üß† Supports multiple RUAccent models: `tiny`, `turbo`, `turbo3.1`, `big_poetry`, and more
* üßπ Can use dictionary-based or purely neural accenting
* ‚Ü∫ Optional manual model reload (`force_reload`)
* üóæ Allows custom accent dictionaries
* ‚öôÔ∏è Runs on CPU or GPU

## Installation

1. **Copy the node files**
   Place all project files into a subfolder (e.g. `ComfyUI-RUAccent/`) inside your `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` directory.

2. **Install RUAccent**
   Make sure Python 3.9+ is installed in your environment, then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
